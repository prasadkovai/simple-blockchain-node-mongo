Implementation of Simple Blockchain using NodeJS &amp; MongoDB

# Run example
`$ node example.js`

# Disclaimer
Please also note, NodeJS is not the best language to implement complex Blockchain implementation due to its Single Thread limitations. Blockchain application requires a lot of computational operations other than I/O, so multi-threaded supported languages would perform better. This repository meant to demonstrate the basic operating principle used by blockchain only and not recommended for production use at all.
